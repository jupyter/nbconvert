Converting Notebooks to Other Formats
=====================================

The ``nbconvert`` tool allows you to convert an ``.ipynb`` notebook
document file into various static formats. It can also execute notebooks
programmatically.

Currently, ``nbconvert`` is provided as a command line tool, run as a script
using Jupyter. It also powers the 'Download as' feature within the
Jupyter Notebook web app.
