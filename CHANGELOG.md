### Significant Changes

Nbconvert 6.0 is a major release of nbconvert which includes many
significant changes.

- Python 2 support was dropped. Currently Python 3.6-3.8 is supported
  and tested by nbconvert. However, nbconvert 6.0 provides limited
  support for Python 3.6. nbconvert 6.1 will drop support for Python
  3.6. Limited support means we will test and run CI on Python 3.6.12
  or higher. Issues that are found only affecting Python 3.6 are not
  guaranteed to be fixed. We recommend all users of nbconvert use
  Python 3.7 and higher.
- Unlike previous versions, nbconvert 6.0 relies on the
  [nbclient](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/) package for the
  execute preprocessor, which allows for asynchronous kernel requests.
- `template_path` has become `template_paths`. If referring to a 5.x
  style `.tpl` template use the full path with the `template_file`
  argument to the file. On the command line the pattern is
  `--template-file=<path/to/file.tpl>`.
- Nbconvert 6.0 includes a new "webpdf" exporter, which renders
  notebooks in pdf format through a headless web browser, so that
  complex outputs such as HTML tables, or even widgets are rendered in
  the same way as with the HTML exporter and a web browser.
- The default template applied when exporting to HTML now produces the
  same DOM structure as JupyterLab, and is styled using JupyterLab's
  CSS. The pygments theme in use mimics JupyterLab's codemirror mode
  with the same CSS variables, so that custom JupyterLab themes could
  be applied. The classic notebook styling can still be enabled with

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --template classic
```

- Nbconvert 6.0 includes a new system for creating custom templates,
  which can now be installed as packages. A custom "foobar" template
  is installed in Jupyter's data directory under
  `nbconvert/templates` and has the form of a directory containing all
  resources. Templates specify their base template as well as other
  configuration parameters in a `conf.json` at the root of the
  template directory.
- The "slideshow" template now makes use of RevealJS version 4. It
  can now be used with the HTML exporter with

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --template reveal
```

The `--to slides` exporter is still supported for convenience.

- Inkscape 1.0 is now supported, which had some breaking changes that
  prevented 5.x versions of nbconvert from converting documents on
  some systems that updated.

### Significant Changes

#### Jupter Client Pin

The `jupyter_client` dependency is now pinned to `>5.3.1`. This is done
to support the Parallel NBConvert below, and
future versions may require interface changes from that version.

#### Parallel NBConvert

NBConvert `--execute` can now be run in parallel via threads,
multiprocessing, or async patterns! This means you can now parallelize
nbconvert via a bash loop, or a python concurrency pattern and it should
be able to execute those notebooks in parallel.

Kernels have varying support for safe concurrent execution. The ipython
kernel (ipykernel version 1.5.2 and higher) should be safe to run
concurrently using Python 3. However, the Python 2 ipykernel does not
always provide safe concurrent execution and sometimes fails with a
socket bind exception. Unlike ipykernel which is maintained by the
project, other community-maintained kernels may have varying support for
concurrent execution, and these kernels were not tested heavily.

Issues for nbconvert can be viewed here: [#1018](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/1018), and [#1017](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/1017)

#### Execute Loop Rewrite

This release completely rewrote the execution loop responsible for
monitoring kernel messages until cell execution is completed. This
removes an error where kernel messages could be dropped if too many were
posted too quickly. Furthermore, the change means that messages are not
buffered. Now, messages can be logged immediately rather than waiting
for the cell to terminate.

See [#994](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/994) for exact code changes if
you're curious.

### Significant Changes

#### Deprecations

Python 3.4 support was dropped. Many of our upstream libraries stopped
supporting 3.4 and it was found that serious bugs were being caught
during testing against those libraries updating past 3.4.

See [#979](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/979) for details.

#### IPyWidget Support

Now when a notebook executing contains [Jupyter
Widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/), the state of
all the widgets can be stored in the notebook's metadata. This allows
rendering of the live widgets on, for instance nbviewer, or when
converting to html.

You can tell nbconvert to not store the state using the
`store_widget_state` argument:

```
jupyter nbconvert --ExecutePreprocessor.store_widget_state=False --to notebook --execute mynotebook.ipynb
```

This widget rendering is not performed against a browser during
execution, so only widget default states or states manipulated via user
code will be calculated during execution. `%%javascript` cells will
execute upon notebook rendering, enabling complex interactions to
function as expected when viewed by a UI.

If you can't view widget results after execution, you may need to
select `File --> Trust Notebook` in the menu.

See [#779](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/779), [#900](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/900), and [#983](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/983) for details.

#### Execute Preprocessor Rework

Based on monkey patching required in
[papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill/blob/0.19.1/papermill/preprocess.py)
the `run_cell` code path in the ExecutePreprocessor was reworked to
allow for accessing individual message parses without reimplementing the
entire function. Now there is a `process_message` function which take a
ZeroMQ message and applies all of its side-effect updates on the
cell/notebook objects before returning the output it generated, if it
generated any such output.

The change required a much more extensive test suite covering cell
execution as test coverage on the various, sometimes wonky, code paths
made improvements and reworks impossible to prove undamaging. Now
changes to kernel message processing has much better coverage, so future
additions or changes with specs over time will be easier to add.

See [#905](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/905) and [#982](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/982) for details

#### Out Of Memory Kernel Failure Catches

When running out of memory on a machine, if the kernel process was
killed by the operating system it would result in a timeout error at
best and hang indefinitely at worst. Now regardless of timeout
configuration, if the underlying kernel process dies before emitting any
messages to the effect an exception will be raised notifying the
consumer of the lost kernel within a few seconds.

See [#959](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/959), [#971](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/971), and [#998](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/998) for details

#### Latex / PDF Template Improvements

The latex template was long overdue for improvements. The default
template had a rewrite which makes exports for latex and pdf look a lot
better. Code cells in particular render much better with line breaks and
styling the more closely matches notebook browser rendering. Thanks
t-makaro for the efforts here!

See [#992](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/992) for details

## 5.4

[5.4 on Github](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/milestones/5.4)

### Significant Changes

#### Deprecations

Python 3.3 support was dropped. The version of python is no longer
common and new versions have many fixes and interface improvements that
warrant the change in support.

See [#843](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/843) for implementation details.

#### Changes in how we handle metadata

There were a few new metadata fields which are now respected in
nbconvert.

`nb.metadata.authors` metadata attribute will be respected in latex
exports. Multiple authors will be added with `,` separation against
their names.

`nb.metadata.title` will be respected ahead of `nb.metadata.name` for
title assignment. This better matches with the notebook format.

`nb.metadata.filename` will override the default
`output_filename_template` when extracting notebook resources in the
`ExtractOutputPreprocessor`. The attribute is helpful for when you want
to consistently fix to a particular output filename, especially when you
need to set image filenames for your exports.

The `raises-exception` cell tag
(`nb.cells[].metadata.tags[raises-exception]`) allows for cell
exceptions to not halt execution. The tag is respected in the same way
by [nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) and other
notebook interfaces. `nb.metadata.allow_errors` will apply this rule for
all cells. This feature is toggleable with the `force_raise_errors`
configuration option. Errors from executing the notebook can be allowed
with a `raises-exception` tag on a single cell, or the `allow_errors`
configurable option for all cells. An allowed error will be recorded in
notebook output, and execution will continue. If an error occurs when it
is not explicitly allowed, a 'CellExecutionError' will be raised. If
`force_raise_errors` is True, `CellExecutionError` will be raised for
any error that occurs while executing the notebook. This overrides both
the `allow_errors` option and the `raises-exception` cell tags.

See [#867](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/867), [#703](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/703), [#685](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/685),
[#672](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/672), and [#684](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/684) for implementation changes.

#### Configurable kernel managers when executing notebooks

The kernel manager can now be optionally passed into the
`ExecutePreprocessor.preprocess` and the `executenb` functions as the
keyword argument `km`. This means that the kernel can be configured as
desired before beginning preprocessing.

This is useful for executing in a context where the kernel has external
dependencies that need to be set to non-default values. An example of
this might be a Spark kernel where you wish to configure the Spark
cluster location ahead of time without building a new kernel.

Overall the ExecutePreprocessor has been reworked to make it easier to
use. Future releases will continue this trend to make this section of
the code more inheritable and reusable by others. We encourage you read
the source code for this version if you're interested in the detailed
improvements.

See [#852](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/852) for implementation changes.

#### Surfacing exporters in front-ends

Exporters are now exposed for front-ends to consume, including classic
notebook. As an example, this means that latex exporter will be made
available for latex 'text/latex' media type from the Download As
interface.

See [#759](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/759) and [#864](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/864) for implementation changes.

#### Raw Templates

Template exporters can now be assigned raw templates as string
attributes by setting the `raw_template` variable.

```python
class AttrExporter(TemplateExporter):
    # If the class has a special template and you want it defined within the class
    raw_template = """{%- extends 'rst.tpl' -%}
{%- block in_prompt -%}
raw template
{%- endblock in_prompt -%}
    """


exporter_attr = AttrExporter()
output_attr, _ = exporter_attr.from_notebook_node(nb)
assert "raw template" in output_attr
```

See [#675](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/675) for implementation changes.

#### New command line flags

The `--no-input` will hide input cells on export. This is great for
notebooks which generate "reports" where you want the code that was
executed to not appear by default in the extracts.

An alias for `notebook` was added to exporter commands. Now `--to ipynb`
will behave as `--to notebook` does.

See [#825](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/825) and [#873](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/873) for implementation changes.

### Major features

#### Tag Based Element Filtering

For removing individual elements from notebooks, we need a way to signal
to nbconvert that the elements should be removed. With this release, we
introduce the use of tags for that purpose.

Tags are user-defined strings attached to cells or outputs. They are
stored in cell or output metadata. For more on tags see the [nbformat
docs on cell
metadata](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata).

**Usage**:

1. Apply tags to the elements that you want to remove.

For removing an entire cell, the cell input, or all cell outputs apply
the tag to the cell.

For removing individual outputs, put the tag in the output metadata
using a call like
`display(your_output_element, metadata={tags=[<your_tags_here>]})`.

_NB_: Use different tags depending on whether you want to remove the
entire cell, the input, all outputs, or individual outputs.

2. Add the tags for removing the different kinds of elements to the
   following traitlets. Which kind of element you want to remove
   determines which traitlet you add the tags to.

The following traitlets remove elements of different kinds:

- `remove_cell_tags`: removes cells
- `remove_input_tags`: removes inputs
- `remove_all_outputs_tag`: removes all outputs
- `remove_single_output_tag`: removes individual outputs

## 5.2.1

[5.2 on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/milestones/5.2)

### Major features

In this release (along with the usual bugfixes and documentation
improvements, which are legion) we have a few new major features that
have been requested for a long time:

#### Global Content Filtering

You now have the ability to remove input or output from code cells,
markdown cells and the input and output prompts. The easiest way to
access all of these is by using traitlets like
TemplateExporter.exclude_input = True (or, for example
HTMLExporter.exclude_markdown = True if you wanted to make it specific
to HTML output). On the command line if you just want to not have input
or output prompts just use --no-prompt.

#### Execute notebooks from a function

You can now use the executenb function to execute notebooks as though
you ran the execute preprocessor on the notebooks. It returns the
standard notebook and resources options.

#### Remove cells based on regex pattern

This removes cells based on their matching a regex pattern (by default,
empty cells). This is the RegexRemovePreprocessor.

#### Script exporter entrypoints for nonpython scripts

Now there is an entrypoint for having an exporter specific to the type
of script that is being exported. While designed for use with the
IRkernel in particular (with a script exporter focused on exporting R
scripts) other non-python kernels that wish to have a language specific
exporter can now surface that directly.
